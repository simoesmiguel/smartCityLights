# smartCityLights
Intelligent public lighting for smart cities

The aim of this project is to implement an IoT system which is able to detect the presence of movement in the sidewalk. This work represents an implementation of a modular and scalable system to control public lights, saving energy but preserving adequate levels of comfort and security. The overall system has some degree of fault tolerance and fail-safe behavior. 

In order to exhibit a realistic behavior, the public lights were replaced by LEDs. All public lights have their own controllers which are interconnected through an I2C bus.
